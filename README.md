# RAGify

RAGify is a collection of advanced implementations and experiments with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a cutting-edge framework combining information retrieval systems with generative AI. This repository is designed to help researchers, developers, and enthusiasts build intelligent, context-aware systems for various applications.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository currently contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built from scratch**. It showcases the foundational steps and techniques for:

- Setting up a retrieval system.
- Integrating a generative model with retrieved knowledge.
- Creating an end-to-end RAG workflow.

## 🌟 Applications of RAG
RAG is a powerful framework with numerous applications, including:

1. **Intelligent Chatbots**: Build bots capable of retrieving and answering queries from vast knowledge bases.
2. **Document Search and Summarization**: Search large document repositories and generate concise summaries.
3. **Education and Training**: Provide learners with tailored answers from curated content libraries.

## 🖼️ Workflow Overview
Here is a high-level visualization of how RAG works:

1. **Query Input**: A user provides a query.
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Relevant documents are fetched from a knowledge base.
3. **Context Injection**: Retrieved documents are provided to the generative model as context.
4. **Response Generation**: The generative model produces a response based on the context and query.
